Basically a simple python script which does tiling on any windowmanager (Perfectly on pekwm and openbox. Partly on compiz due to the fact that compiz says it has a single desktop even if there are 4 virtual desktops, which means all the windows you have will be tiled).
It uses wmctrl to get the info and manage the windows. Bind it to a key or to autowhatever-on-window-creation-hook.

Currently options are
simple - The basic tiling layout . 1 Main + all other at the side.

left,right - Does the new windows7 ish style of sticking to the sides.

swap - will swap the active window to master column

cycle - Cycle all the windows in the master pane

vertical - simple vertical tiling

horizontal - simple horizontal tiling

You can change the main window factor BottomPadding TopPadding LeftPadding RightPadding though it detects most of the panels. You may have to change wintitle and border according to your theme.

If you need other layouts modify get_simple_tile
